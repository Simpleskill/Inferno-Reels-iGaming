Pentasia - Senior Game Developer Technical Test


***************************************************
 THE TEST
***************************************************


To create a simple 3 reel slot machine using JavaScript ES5 or ES6.

We realise everyone has different levels of skill and experience when it comes to development, so we have split the test into 3 sections. If you do not have the knowledge to complete them all then that's ok, we just want to see how you approach the problem and get a feel for how you code.

As a hint have a look for ‘Slot Machine’ in the search engine of your choice. If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with your point of contact. We’ll get back to you as soon as possible. We are not expected super graphics, this is not the point of the exercise. https://www.leovegas.com/en-row/game/fire-joker is a great point of reference to see the kind of game needed here.

No Sounds required

Required Tasks

· Spin button that triggers the reel spin.

· Spinning Reels which will display a random outcome when the spin button is pressed. (You can make them appear to spin if you wish). Reels are to display 3 symbols per reel, with 3 different types of symbol (e.g. cherry, banana, melon).

· Use of tweens / animations for reel spinning and should simple winning symbols

Optional Tasks

· We would like you to make the canvas auto fit to the current window size, so the game works on all mobile devices and desktop machines.

· Have your game handle pixel ratio and load higher res graphics if required.

· Feel free to work with Pixi.js or any other framework you like to work with.

Artwork can be programmer art or anything you find around on the web.

Review Criteria

We will be looking for:

    · Modular/Code organisation.

    · Generic where appropriate.

    · Use of inheritance.

    · Clarity/Self documenting.

    · Indenting.

    · Use of camel case.

    · Demonstrate understanding of JS scope.

    · Optimised code.

    · Use of callbacks / timers.

    · Basic Error Handling.

Submission

The contents of an accompanying README.md should contain:

    · A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.

    · Any instructions required to run your solution and tests in a Windows environment.

A link to the git repository or some other code sharing platform showing your commit history.
